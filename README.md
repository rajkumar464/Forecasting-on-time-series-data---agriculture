We are given the monthly production quantity for a certain agricultural product (letâ€™s call it Grople syrup, note - no relation to actual Maple Syrup) in 10 different provinces of a country between January 2015 to December 2020. This Grople syrup comes from a fruit. It takes a few months for the fruits to grow on the trees which bear them. It also takes a few days to extract the syrup from the fruits after they have been harvested.

The goal is to predict the monthly production quantity from January 2021 to December 2021

We have been given 5 .csv files containing pertinent data. Here are the files and their descriptions.
